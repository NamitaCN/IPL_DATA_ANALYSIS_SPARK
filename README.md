# IPL_DATA_ANALYSIS_SPARK

Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for analyzing IPL (Indian Premier League) match data from 2008 onwards. The analysis involves storing and processing large datasets on AWS and performing data transformations and visualizations using Apache Spark and Python libraries.

Project Workflow
1. Data Storage on AWS S3
   
The large dataset, containing detailed information about IPL matches since 2008, was stored securely on Amazon S3.
The data consists of 5 tables, each capturing various aspects of the matches, including player statistics, match outcomes, and more.  

2. Security and Access Management  

Security settings were established using VPN to ensure secure access to the data.
An AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) account was created to manage permissions and control access to the S3 bucket.  

3. Data Processing on Databricks  

The code for processing and analyzing the data was written on Databricks, leveraging the power of Apache Spark.
Initial data transformations were performed using Spark SQL to clean and prepare the data for analysis.  

4. Data Transformation and Analysis  

After loading the data into Spark, I performed various data transformations to structure and prepare the data for analysis.
Spark SQL was utilized for efficient data querying and transformation, ensuring the dataset was ready for deeper analysis.  

5. Data Visualization  

For data visualization, Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn were used.
These visualizations provided insights into various aspects of IPL matches, such as player performances, match outcomes, and trends over the years.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how to handle and analyze large datasets using modern cloud and big data technologies. By leveraging the power of AWS and Apache Spark, combined with Pythonâ€™s data visualization libraries, we can extract meaningful insights from IPL match data.
